# Sorry.
This project is **abandoned**. It turns out that ASDF is by far not flexible enough or favourable to massive extensions like this, making it too much of a hassle to turn it into a usable system for building projects in any source other than Lisp itself. And even for that it is debatably not quite the baller.

The current plan is to write an entirely new build system that is written from the ground up with the intention in mind of being usable for any language or environment. This is a difficult task, and as such it will take a lot of hard thinking. I cannot claim to know when I can actually start writing code for it, let alone when it will be finished.

Please wait patiently.
